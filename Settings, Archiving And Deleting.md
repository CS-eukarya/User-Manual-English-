**A** . **Project Info** is the basic information of the project that'll be used within Re: Earth. This information like (name, project summary, thumbnail image) is the same content you filled in when you created the project.

**B** . **Danger Zone** contains operations that will affect the accessibility of your project. This includes archiving and deleting your project. These operations affect the accessibility of the project, so caution is needed when using them.

## Archive Your Project

Projects that have been completed or will not be edited for the time being can be archived. This will hide them from the Dashboard and lock editing. Published projects will stay accessible.

When you want to modify the project again, just unarchive the project from the project's settings.

**Setup to Archive a Project**
<br>
From project settings, click the "Archive Project" button.

A popup will then appear. Enter the name of the project you wish to Archive and click the "Are you sure you want to Archive?" button to complete the process.

## Unarchive projects

As mentioned, once the project is archived you will not be able to find it on the Dashboard. You can find all archived projects listed at the bottom of the Project list page.

## Deleting your project

If some projects become unnecessary, they can be completely deleted. In Re:Earth, deleting a project means completely removing all information and data related to the project, including plugins and datasets.

**Steps to Delete a Project:**

At the bottom of the settings page, there is a [Delete Project] button under important operations.

Click that button, enter the name of the project you want to delete in the popup that appears, and then click the "Delete this project." button to complete the deletion.
