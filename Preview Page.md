# Preview Page

In the preview, you can see how the Digital Earth you are currently editing will look after it is published.

To check the preview, click **`Preview`** on the upper right of the screen.

The preview reflects what you have edited so far.

(For projects that have already been published, the edited contents will not be reflected unless the project is published again.)
