# Adding and Removing Assets

## Adding Assets
There are two ways to add images and files to assets.
You can "add from the asset library" or "add from the project edit screen."
When adding from the asset library, Re:Earth allows you to select multiple files at once, 
so you can upload many files to the library at once.
