# Adding and Removing Assets

## Adding Assets
There are two ways to add images and files to assets.
You can "add from the asset library" or "add from the project edit screen."
When adding from the asset library, Re:Earth allows you to select multiple files at once, 
so you can upload many files to the library at once.

### Adding Assets from the Asset Library

### How to Delete Assets

You can add assets from two places: the Asset Library and the Project Edit screen. 
But, you can only delete assets from the Asset Library.
You can delete more than one asset at a time.

1. Choose the asset(s) you want to delete.
2. Click the "Delete" button at the top right.
