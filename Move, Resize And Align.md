**B. Gap Spacing:** specifies the spacing between widgets within an area. The gap spacing setting allows users to control the amount of space between digital twin elements, and to fine-tune the layout and design of their digital twin projects. Users can create more or less space between elements by adjusting the gap spacing, depending on their needs and preferences.

Depending on the widget, it can be scaled vertically, horizontally or both; if an icon with two arrows pointing outwards is displayed, the widget is scalable.

The `Storytelling' installed by default is a good example of this. Move the` Storytelling' widget to the center at the bottom and click the `arrow button` to extend the widget horizontally to its full width.
