# Create, Delete And Update Layer Folders

In Re:Earth, you can add various items to the map. All items that can be displayed on the digital earth (e.g., [Markers](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/fa48cb0bbd917626c85c313605deb2dafc1de6d4/Marker.md), [3D models](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/fa48cb0bbd917626c85c313605deb2dafc1de6d4/3D%20Model.md), [Photo overlays](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/fa48cb0bbd917626c85c313605deb2dafc1de6d4/Photo%20Overlay.md), etc.) are managed as layers. In this section, we will guide you through layer folders, which allow you to organize these individual layers.
*For detailed instructions on how to create each layer, please refer to their respective item pages.


## Create Layer Folders

By creating layer folders, you can group individual layers displayed within a layer. This is useful for organizing a large number of layers. 

Here, we will explain an example of creating a new layer folder and storing three existing markers within a layer into the layer folder.
