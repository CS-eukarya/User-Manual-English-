# What is an asset?
<br>
In Re-earth, an asset is any resource that can be utilized in order to provide user scarification. This can include things like Images, buildings, equipment, and even Documents.


Images and files used in Re-Earth are considered assets.

Assets are linked to workspaces, allowing them to be shared and used across projects.
