# About Assets

## What is an asset?
<br>
In Re-earth, an asset is any resource that can be utilized in order to provide user scarification. This can include things like Images, buildings, equipment, Documents and more.

<br>

Images and files used in Re-Earth are considered assets.

Assets are linked to workspaces, allowing them to be shared and used across projects.
