# Timeline

### What is Timeline?

The "Timeline" feature is a tool that visually displays changes in data over time. Users can easily see changes and transitions in data at specific points in time, and can analyze data from the past, present, and future using the timeline. This feature is used to adjust the timing of drawings, add keyframes, and arrange layers in order.

When motion is set for a 3D object, it is activated as an animation for the object. In addition, you can use the timeline function built into Cesium.
