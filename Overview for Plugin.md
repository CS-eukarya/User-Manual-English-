Re:Earth users can enhance the platform's functionality by developing their own plugins or utilizing plugins developed by other users within the community.

For example, you can extend the content of the infobox displayed when a marker is selected, or add plugins to Re:Earth's original widgets to enable processes that are not possible with the standard Re:Earth features.
