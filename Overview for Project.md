# Overview

The Project workspace is where all the magic happens in Re-Earth. Edit, publish, import your data, and more.

Once you create a project you can open the editor page and by default, you will see a digital earth floating in the universe. When a project is created, a scene will be created, attached, and used by your project. Currently, only Cesium-based scenes are available, but more will come in the future. For more information about scenes, please see the chapter on [scenes](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/3c5ed956a9ffc94cbd543ddfe0a9a54465b87c82/Overview%20for%20Scene.md)

As described in the previous chapters, you can add and build various content on the earth. Treat the project like an eagle,  the earth itself the canvas, and Re-Earth the set of brushes and tools to help you create your vision.
