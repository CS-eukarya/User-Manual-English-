# Overview

The Project workspace is where all the magic happens in Re-Earth. Edit, publish, import your data, and more.

Once you create a project you can open the editor page and by default, you will see a digital earth floating in the universe. When a project is created, a scene will be created, attached, and used by your project. Currently, only Cesium-based scenes are available, but more will come in the future. For more information about scenes, please see the chapter on **[scenes](https://docs.reearth.io/user-manual/scene/ideas-of-scene)**

As described in the previous chapters, you can add and build various content on the earth. Treat the project like an eagle,  the earth itself the canvas, and Re-Earth the set of brushes and tools to help you create your vision.

The following operations are available on a project:

- [Create](Create%20A%20New%20Project%20663077dd2163491fb48e27debfae1471.md)
- [**Archive**](Settings,%20Archiving%20And%20Deleting%20eba9dfc58f4042f8ad064602fae9afbc.md)
- [Delete](Settings,%20Archiving%20And%20Deleting%20eba9dfc58f4042f8ad064602fae9afbc.md)

## **Project settings page**

In the settings page, project-specific settings can be accessed where you can modify things like its title or add basic auth, manage its datasets, or the plugins used by the project.

### Collaborative Editing

With the workspace system, it becomes possible for team members to collaborate and edit together. Members who are in the same workspace can edit the same project.
