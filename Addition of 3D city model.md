# Addition of 3D city model

A 3D city model is digital data that represents urban structures such as buildings, roads, and parks in three dimensions.

Using PLATEAU data and open data, it is possible to visualize 3D cities, which can be utilized in various fields such as urban planning, disaster prevention, and tourism.
