## Basic Authorization

Basic authentication is one of the methods for restricting access to web pages protected by the HTTP protocol.

With basic authentication enabled, users without a specific **username and password** will not be able to view webpages.

On the other hand, disabling basic authentication allows anyone to access the webpage.

- The default setting for basic authentication is disabled. 
- Only if you want to enable it as necessary, please follow the steps below to set it.
