# Install And Remove Plugins

This section explains how to install and remove plugins.

## Installation Procedure

There are two main types of plugins you can install:
- Public Plugins: These are plugins that are available to everyone and can be found in the Re:Earth Plugin Library.
- Personal Plugins: These are plugins that you have created or downloaded from a third-party source.
For more information on the differences between these two types of plugins, please see the [Plugin Library](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/Project/Plugin%20Library.md).

### How to Install Personal Plugins

Access the Plugin Library and select the "Personal Installed" tab.

There are two ways to install plugins here:

- Upload Zip File from PC: Install a plugin by selecting a zip file from your computer.
- Public GitHub Repository: Install a plugin directly from a public GitHub repository.

We will guide you through both installation methods in order.

### Upload Zip file from PC

1. Access the plugin library and select "Upload Zip file from PC".

If an error occurs here, the following causes are possible.

There is an error in the format of reearth.yml.

- A plugin with the same ID is already installed. Please remove the existing plugin and run the installation again.
- The ZIP file does not contain reearth.yml or there are multiple directories in the root. Compress a single folder containing reearth.yml or multiple files containing reearth.yml.
- An invalid ZIP file may be output depending on the application that generates the ZIP file. Please compress using other applications.
