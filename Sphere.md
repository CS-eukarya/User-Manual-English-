A. Position: Set the latitude and longitude to specify the location where the sphere will be displayed.

B. Altitude: Set the altitude at which the sphere will be displayed.

C. Altitude Reference: Choose from "Default," "Clamp to Ground," or "Relative to Ground." When "Default" is selected, the altitude is absolute from the WGS84 ellipsoid (digital earth). "Clamp to Ground" and "Relative to Ground" will only differ from "Default" if the "Terrain" setting is enabled in the scene.

D. Radius: Set the radius of the sphere.

E. Fill Color: Set the color of the sphere.

F. Shadow: Set whether or not the sphere casts a shadow. To enable shadows, you must also enable shadows in the "Scene" settings.
