A. Add Dataset: You can import data from your local PC.

B. Delete Button: This button appears when you hover your mouse over a dataset card.

Currently, dataset management is limited to adding (importing) and deleting datasets.<br>
We plan to expand these features in future development.

<br>
<br>

## How to Add a Dataset

1. Click "Datasets" from the dropdown menu next to the title.

<br>

 - When the text "This field is linked to ~" is displayed in blue, it means that the setting is correct.

<br>

 - Set "Link to dataset" for all the items you want to link.
 - Be sure to select the parent tree of the layer in the left panel before setting "Link to dataset."

## Important Points When Creating CSV Data

- To plot multiple points at once, you need to organize the points in a CSV file.

- Start entering items from row A1.

- The CSV file must contain columns of latitude and longitude values to be plotted, and the column names must be "lat" and "lng" respectively. (Enter in decimal degrees)

- Save the CSV file in "CSV-UTF8" format.

![2024-07-11_22h51_15.png](Adding%20and%20Removing%20Datasets%202d35fb380d1a43b08fd853acd717769d/2024-07-11_22h51_15.png)

<br>


Note: The CSV file in this example has been modified for this manual. Please note that it is different from the actual information.

- **Importing a large amount of CSV data (over 100 items) can put a load on the server and significantly slow down Re:Earth's operation, so please refrain from doing so.**

## How to Delete a Dataset

1. Click "Datasets" from the dropdown menu next to the title.

⚠️Caution⚠️

Before deleting a dataset, make sure it is not being used in any projects. If the dataset is connected to any project, deleting it may cause the connected project to become incomplete.
