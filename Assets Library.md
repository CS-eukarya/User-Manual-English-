# Assets Library

When creating a project, you may need many resources such as photos and models. In Re:Earth, we collectively call these "assets." Asset resources are stored and managed by the workspace, so different projects can share the same asset library. This is useful if a workspace has multiple related projects.

You can view the asset library by selecting "Assets" from the left panel of the settings screen. You can easily view and manage all uploaded assets.
