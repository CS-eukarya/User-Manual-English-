# Idea Of Widget

## What is Widget

**Widget** is a general term for other features that are not placed on the Re-Earth but are placed flat over the scene on the Screen of the Re-Earth App. 

**The widgets that Re-Earth currently provides are as follows:**

- **[Button](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/5c9e19c74aabe9b3722b14191d5cad1ebb2ec462/Button.md):** operates any event (such as camera movement or linking to an external site)
- **[Splash Screen](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/5c9e19c74aabe9b3722b14191d5cad1ebb2ec462/Splash%20Screen.md):** sets the screen displayed when starting a text project
- **[Storytelling](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/5c9e19c74aabe9b3722b14191d5cad1ebb2ec462/Storytelling.md):** moves the layers on the project in order
- **[Timeline](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/5c9e19c74aabe9b3722b14191d5cad1ebb2ec462/Timeline%20for%20Widget.md):** switches the display of data according to time
- **[Navigator](https://github.com/CS-eukarya/User-Manual-English-/blob/5c9e19c74aabe9b3722b14191d5cad1ebb2ec462/Navigator.md):** allows for easy exploration of locations on the earth with simple operations.
