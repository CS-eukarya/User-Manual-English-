## Change file name[](https://docs.reearth.io/user-manual/Asset/manage-asset#change-file-name)

It is not possible to change the file name of an asset on Re-Earth.

If you need to change the file name, please edit the file name of the data before uploading it, After changing the name upload it again as an asset.
